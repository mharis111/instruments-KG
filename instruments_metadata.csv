10.5442/ni000001,E2 - Flat-Cone Diffractometer,"A 3-dimensional part of the reciprocal space can be scanned in less then five steps by combining the “off-plane Bragg-scattering” and the flat-cone layer concept while using a new computer-controlled tilting axis of the detector bank. Parasitic scattering from cryostat or furnace walls is reduced by an oscillating ""radial"" collimator. The datasets and all connected information is stored in one independent NeXus file format for each measurement and can be easily archived. The software package TVneXus deals with the raw data sets, the transformed physical spaces and the usual data analysis tools (e.g. MatLab). TVneXus can convert to various data sets e.g. into powder diffractograms, linear detector projections, rotation crystal pictures or the 2D/3D reciprocal space.",https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/igama_output?modus=einzel&sprache=en&gid=1698,https://ror.org/02aj13c28,Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin Für Materialien Und Energie,['10.17815/jlsrf-4-110'],[]
10.5442/ni000002,E9 - Fine Resolution Powder Diffractometer (FIREPOD),"The Fine Resolution Powder Diffractometer E9 (FIREPOD) is an angle-dispersive powder diffractometer optimized for a flat resolution function with a minimum width of the reflections at the 2Θ-region with the highest density of reflections. The monochromator is placed at a distance of 11 m from the reactor core, which allows for a large take-off angle at the monochromator. An evacuated beam tube and a sapphire single crystal filter reduce air scattering and epithermal neutrons. Neutron flux at the sample is increased by an adjustable vertically focusing Ge-monochromator. The detector consists of eight individual DENEX ³He 2D detectors with 300 × 300 mm active area each and a common radial collimator to reduce background noise. The individual detectors are arranged in a novel setup, at optimized, non-constant distances from the sample. Five of the individual detectors can be placed close to the sample in a high intensity conformation. Data collection with fixed detector position measures parts of the 2Θ-range with increased intensity and without loss in quality. Position-sensitive data integration of the Debye cones results in a strongly reduced asymmetry of the peaks. The 2D-data are directly accessible, allowing the early detection of preferred orientation or spottiness.",https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/igama_output?modus=einzel&sprache=en&gid=1702,https://ror.org/02aj13c28,Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin Für Materialien Und Energie,['10.17815/jlsrf-3-127'],[]

The vertically focusing graphite monochromator provides adjustable wavelengths between 0.4 nm and 0.6 nm, making use of the full cross section of the neutron guide (3 cm wide, 12.5 cm high). A movable Be-filter at liquid nitrogen temperature may be used to suppress second order wavelengths below 0.39 nm. If less stringent collimation conditions allow, high flux at short monochromator - sample distances (approx. 80 cm) are made possible by a compact construction of shieldings.

10.5442/ni000015,V7 - Cold Neutron Tomography and Radiography (CONRAD),"The neutron tomography beam line V7 was designed with two measuring positions: the first one is located directly at the end of the neutron guide, where a very high neutron flux is available but the image resolution is limited due to the beam divergence. The second measuring position uses a pin-hole geometry followed by more than 5m of flight tube in order to gain a high collimation ratio and image resolution. The high-flux measuring position allows to perform unique experiments in the field of real-time imaging and high-speed tomography with exposure times ranging from 10 ms to 500 ms. The achieved resolution varies from 300 µm to 500 µm dependent on the distance between the sample and the detector.",https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/igama_output?modus=einzel&sprache=en&gid=1718,https://ror.org/02aj13c28,Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin Für Materialien Und Energie,['10.17815/jlsrf-2-108'],[]
