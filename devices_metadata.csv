buoy,2423,Snow Buoy 2014S25,"The Snow Buoy determines the distance between four acoustic sounders, mounted on a frame at a height of 1.5 m, and the underlying surface (usually ice and snow). Conversion of the distance data to actual snow height is achieved by calibration to initial in-situ snow depth measurements below the acoustic sounders during deployment. Hourly measurements result in a time series of snow height evolution at the location of the buoy. Negative values of snow height occur if surface ablation continues into the sea ice. Thus, all snow height measurements describe the surface elevation relative to the original snow-ice interface. Differences between single sensors indicate small-scale variability of the snow pack around the buoy. In addition to snow height, geographic position (GPS), barometric pressure, ait temperature and an internal hull temperature are recorded.

The surface unit of the buoy is composed of a ~2 m long metal cylinder housing the batteries, a solid frame carrying the main electronics, a glass half-dome with solar panels, and a stable floatation body around the main hull. The buoy is powered by alkaline batteries sufficient for several months of operation, complemented by a solar-rechargeable power supply to support a higher sampling interval in summer. The underwater unit mainly consists of the AZFP and its 4 downward-looking acoustic transducers (70, 125, 200, and 455 kHz), mounted in a frame fixed to the bottom of the battery cylinder with multiple steel wires and hanging just beneath the ice base. The buoy is running on a Linux operating system, configured to poll the entire sensor suite at regular intervals, and to transmit the recordings to a land-based station via the iridium satellite network. AZFP sampling parameters and measurement intervals can be adjusted via a remote connection at any time.",BOS076,"Bruncin, Zagreb, Croatia",Bruncin Observational System 2.0,https://hdl.handle.net/10013/sensor.1b6f2b86-6d40-42fa-8aa6-b1542783ea1b,"Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research",Marcel Nicolaus

Once installed, SIMB3 directly measures ice growth and ablation using a pair of ice-facing acoustic rangefinders. By independently measuring ice surface and bottom position, SIMB3 can distinguish between surface and bottom melting.

buoy,10999,NKE TRUSTED buoy SVP-BRST 2023P271,"Within the framework of the Trusted project funded by Copernicus, a consortium led by CLS has produced a number of drifting buoys called SVP-BRST. These new generation buoys are equipped with high resolution SST sensors (HR SST) calibrated by the SHOM metrology department in order to provide fiducial reference measurements. The level of accuracy achieved for these buoys is unprecedented for such equipment, including research campaigns. 
As explained in the article in Ocean Sciences, these buoys are able to observe small-scale SST variability.
Over the next three years, the goal is to gather a high quality dataset in key areas of the globe in order to improve the calibration of the sentinel 3 (A & B) radiometers. This will allow a more accurate monitoring of the global sea surface temperatures and enable the detection of more subtle climate change signals.

buoy,1638,Snow Buoy 2018S58,"The Snow Buoy determines the distance between four acoustic sounders, mounted on a frame at a height of 1.5 m, and the underlying surface (usually ice and snow). Conversion of the distance data to actual snow height is achieved by calibration to initial in-situ snow depth measurements below the acoustic sounders during deployment. Hourly measurements result in a time series of snow height evolution at the location of the buoy. Negative values of snow height occur if surface ablation continues into the sea ice. Thus, all snow height measurements describe the surface elevation relative to the original snow-ice interface. Differences between single sensors indicate small-scale variability of the snow pack around the buoy. In addition to snow height, geographic position (GPS), barometric pressure, ait temperature and an internal hull temperature are recorded.

Thus, all snow height measurements describe the surface elevation relative to the original snow-ice interface. Differences between single sensors indicate small-scale variability of the snow pack around the buoy. In addition to snow height, geographic position (GPS), barometric pressure, ait temperature and an internal hull temperature are recorded.

buoy,10998,NKE TRUSTED buoy SVP-BRST 2023P270,"Within the framework of the Trusted project funded by Copernicus, a consortium led by CLS has produced a number of drifting buoys called SVP-BRST. These new generation buoys are equipped with high resolution SST sensors (HR SST) calibrated by the SHOM metrology department in order to provide fiducial reference measurements. The level of accuracy achieved for these buoys is unprecedented for such equipment, including research campaigns. 
As explained in the article in Ocean Sciences, these buoys are able to observe small-scale SST variability.
Over the next three years, the goal is to gather a high quality dataset in key areas of the globe in order to improve the calibration of the sentinel 3 (A & B) radiometers. This will allow a more accurate monitoring of the global sea surface temperatures and enable the detection of more subtle climate change signals.

Conversion of the distance data to actual snow height is achieved by calibration to initial in-situ snow depth measurements below the acoustic sounders during deployment. Hourly measurements result in a time series of snow height evolution at the location of the buoy. Negative values of snow height occur if surface ablation continues into the sea ice. Thus, all snow height measurements describe the surface elevation relative to the original snow-ice interface. Differences between single sensors indicate small-scale variability of the snow pack around the buoy. In addition to snow height, geographic position (GPS), barometric pressure, ait temperature and an internal hull temperature are recorded.

buoy,10997,NKE TRUSTED buoy SVP-BRST 2023P269,"Within the framework of the Trusted project funded by Copernicus, a consortium led by CLS has produced a number of drifting buoys called SVP-BRST. These new generation buoys are equipped with high resolution SST sensors (HR SST) calibrated by the SHOM metrology department in order to provide fiducial reference measurements. The level of accuracy achieved for these buoys is unprecedented for such equipment, including research campaigns. 
As explained in the article in Ocean Sciences, these buoys are able to observe small-scale SST variability.
Over the next three years, the goal is to gather a high quality dataset in key areas of the globe in order to improve the calibration of the sentinel 3 (A & B) radiometers. This will allow a more accurate monitoring of the global sea surface temperatures and enable the detection of more subtle climate change signals.

vehicle,3022,GasQuant II Lander,"The GasQuant II lander system utilizes a multibeam (usually the Imagenex 837B Delta T) for monitoring and quantifying marine gas releases. The multibeam is installed on top of a small tripod. The beams are aligned horizontally to the ocean floor in range of gas seepages to detect and monitor rising gas bubbles. The system was built as the successor of the Gas Quant I system (Greinert et al., 2008), which has been successfully used for tempo-spatial variability of gas releases in the past. The new system is lighter (ca. 43 kg), more energy efficient and designed for ROV deployments.

Besides the multibeam, the lander system consists of an Enitech battery system, a power and 
computer housing and a compass. In addition a Sea & Sun CTD was attached to the metal tripod. To record data a predefined script is started after switching power on. The script contains the start and end time, range and gain settings.

L3m is a regular (mapped) global grid with a resolution of 8640x4320 pixels and the L3b is a irregular (binned) 
sinusoidal grid with an equal area resolution. For scientific purposes the L3b format is recommended. See the Product User Guide (PUG) under Resources for further details .

Error statistics from the initial sensor characterisation are used as an input to the merging methods and propagate through the merging process to provide error estimates for the output merged products. These error estimates are a key component of GlobColour as they are invaluable to the users; particularly the modellers who need them in order to assimilate the ocean colour data into ocean simulations.

vessel,7676,Albis,"ALBIS is a research platform to solve complex environmental issues in river ecology. It allows the sampling of water and sediment from any interesting sampling point in the river at varying seasonal and hydrological conditions. The vessel is designed for investigations of shallow water areas, which are of special importance. The samples are prepared directly after sampling on board of the vessel. Special features of the board laboratory are cooling and freezing capacity as well as various sampling techniques and probes for complementary tests. Current research interests are related to the catchment area of the Elbe River. In the main focus are investigations of sources, transport and fate of pollutants originated from former mining areas, urban areas as well as contaminated old sediments. In this context, the possibility of a quasi timely flow sampling is important for the assessment of transport processes. Another focus is research on the control of riverine food webs and biological processes.",,,,https://hdl.handle.net/10013/sensor.a69fa676-e844-4b5a-b82d-13d75dc4c519,Helmholtz-Zentrum für Umweltforschung GmbH - UFZ,Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ

Das 55 Meter lange Schiff verfügt über vier Labore, in denen unter anderem Luft-, Wasser- und Sedimentproben untersucht werden können. Primäre Forschungs­disziplinen der ALKOR sind die Ozeano­graphie, Biologie, Fischereibiologie, Geophysik sowie Geologie. Das Forschungsschiff bietet Platz für 12 Wissen­schaftler:innen.

Gebaut wurde die nach einem Stern im Bild des Großen Bären benannte ALKOR als Nachfolgerin eines gleich­namigen Forschungskutters, der 1990 nach 24 Jahren im Dienst der Wissenschaft den Anforderungen an Technik und Umweltfreundlichkeit nicht mehr entsprach. Die heutige ALKOR unternimmt Expeditionen mit deutschen und europäischen Forschergruppen. Sie ist darüber hinaus bei Lehr- und Praktikumsfahrten für Studenten im Einsatz. Von der ALKOR aus können ebenfalls das Tauchboot JAGO sowie ROV PHOCA und AUV ABYSS eingesetzt werden. Sie ist ein Schwesterschiff der auf Helgoland beheimateten HEINCKE.

Zurzeit wird die ALKOR durch die Briese ­Schiffahrts GmbH bereedert. Sie hat die Fahrterlaubnis „Große Fahrt“ gemäß Funkgebiet A2. Die Standzeit in See beträgt 21 Tage. Eine Grundüber­holung und Modernisierung des Schiffes wurde Ende 2010 abgeschlossen.

The MOSES Sternfahrt was carried out by the three ships Mya II (Cuxhaven-Helgoland), Prandtl (Cuxhaven-Helgoland) and Littorina (Büsum - Helgoland) and back respectively. The aim of the cruise was to coordinate the three ships to record large-scale distribution patterns of basic water parameters, greenhouse gases (air and water), radiation in the Elbe estuary. The trip was divided into two days. On the first day the cut was driven from the mainland to the island, on the second day the cut from the island to the mainland. The routes are given in the document MOSES Sternfahrt 1. The measurements are supplemented by the FerryBoxes on the two passenger ships MS Helgoland and MS Funny Girl. The route of the Mya II was the same as the route of the MS Helgoland, the route of the Prandtl was the same as the route of the MS FunyGirl, the Littorina leads the Eiderschnittstrecke. On the first day there was a rendezvous with the MS Helgoland (Mya II) where the MS Helgoland stopped and the Mya II took a profile with water samples. The exact position of the rendevouz was the 7 station in the plan. The geneune coordinates are stored in the DSHIP system of the Mya. The Prandtl met the MS FunnyGirl and the MS FunnyGirl did not stop while the Prandtl drove a profile with water samples. Littorina: enter action. 
On 16.04 on the route to Helgoland between 7 and 10 depth profiles (Mya II CTD578, Prandl , Littorina ) were taken from all ships additionally at fixed stations (see route planning). The water samples were taken with 3 replicas each (connected samples from the same creator). The three replicas are analysed independently at the three institutes (HZG, GEOMAR, AWI).

model,7806,HZG Model of Circulation in North and Baltic sea,""" A nested grid circulation model for the German Bight “
The circulation modelling-platforms in COSYNA is based on the nested-grid General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM, Burchard and Bolding, 2002). GETM is a primitive equation prognostic three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The use of generalized vertical coordinates makes it  suitable for shallow coastal regions under the influence of tidal currents. In this model the  equations for the three  velocity components, sea-surface height, temperature, salinity, as well as the  equations for turbulent kinetic energy and the eddy dissipation rate due to  viscosity are solved. A particular feature of GETM is its ability to  adequately represent the dynamics in deep inlets and channels as well as on  the tidal fats, the latter falling dry during part of the tidal period.

The nested-grid model consists of three  model configurations: a coarse-resolution North Sea-Baltic Sea (~ 5 km) outer model, a fine-resolution (~ 1 km) inner model covering  the German Bight and a very fine-resolution (~ 200 m) model for the  Wadden Sea region resolving the barrier islands and the tidal flats. The  bathymetric data for the different model configurations are prepared using  the ETOPO-1 topography, together with observations made available from the BSH.

Terrain following equidistant coordinates  (s-coordinates) are used for the vertical dimension.  The water column is discretised into 21 nonintersecting layers. The model system is forced by: (1) atmospheric fluxes estimated by the bulk formulation using 1-hourly forecasts from the German Weather Service (DWD), (2) hourly river run-off data provided by the BSH operational model, and (3) time-varying lateral boundary conditions of sea surface elevations and salinity. The sea surface elevations of the open boundary of the North Sea-Baltic Sea model are generated using tidal constituents obtained from the TOPEX/POSEIDON harmonic tide analysis. Temperature and salinity at the open boundary of the outer model are interpolated at each time step using the monthly mean climatological data.

From the in-line air stream, aerosol was continuously sampled at 120 m3 h-1 on two pre-cleaned Whatman 541 cellulose filters (240 mm diameter) in series. The samples refer to a temporal integration of 7 to 14 days which corresponds to sample volumes of around 2x104 m3 to 4x104 m3 STP, respectively. From 2012 ongoing, we exclusively relied on the low volume (LV) sampling device. Thereby aerosol was sampled using a 2-stage filter system, consisting of a teflon and a nylon filter connected in series. Roughly 60 m3 (STP) of ambient air was probed over a typical collection period of 24 hours. Samples were analyzed for MSA, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ by ion chromatography.

plankton net,9133,Working Party 2 plankton net,"The WP-2 (WorkParty-2) net is used for quantitative, depth-integrated capture as well as qualitative capture of zooplankton organisms for experimental work. The net is generally used in vertical hauls, although specific water layers can also be sampled selectively. For this purpose, a closing mechanism is used that can be triggered at a certain water depth with a weight falling from the wire. The net frame usually has a diameter of 57 cm and is equipped with a flowmeter, which is attached to the net frame. The WP-2 net can be equipped with different mesh sizes; 100, 200 or 400 µm are often used.",,,,https://hdl.handle.net/10013/sensor.b088f476-e8a2-422e-bcdc-bd10e4258f03,"Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research",polarstern dship
